- [heroku] - A service to keep the bot online

## Development

How does it work? 

The goal is to make is as easy as possible to use commands.

Therefore we'll explain some in the following!

Give a Role:

```sh
*give @member @role
```

>The Bot needs the [MANAGE_ROLES] permission for this!

Remove a Role:

```sh
*remove @member @role
```
>The Bot needs the [MANAGE_ROLES] permission for this!

Create a Poll:

```sh
*poll [your poll/suggestion]
```

Create Pick up Games:

```sh
*plan [time]
```

> All times are in CEST and between 0 - 24 <br><br>
